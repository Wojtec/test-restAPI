# Mandatory points
* Authentication and authorization. The authentication model must be based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750.

* Include tests (at least 1 unit test, 1 integration test and one end to end tests).

* Using JavaScript ES6.

* Deliver the codebase on github or any source control tool. It would be great if we can see incremental steps at the commits history.

* Use Latest Node.js LTS version.

* DON'T USE A DB. The API REST youyr must to deliver is a middleware, so is very important to propagate the request to the data source INSURANCE API REST and to manage the error handling and the asynchronism.

* Configuration of a linter and some specific rules to maintain code coherence style. For example https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base.
